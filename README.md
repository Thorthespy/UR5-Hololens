# UR5-Hololens
The goal of this project is to create a simulation of the UR5 robot and CB3 controller in Augmented Reality using the Microsoft HoloLens. 
The Master-Branch at the moment is only for basic movement of the robot. In the UR5 Rotation Branch, you can rotate all parts of the arm by yourself. In the Waypoints branch, which is the latest branch, you can add waypoints to a program and play the one after another.
